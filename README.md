# Modeling of (De)Polymerization Processes

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HugoMVale/Polymer-Reaction-Engineering-Lectures/tree/main/notebooks/HEAD)

This GitHub repository contains Jupyter notebooks that illustrate various aspects of polymerization reactions,
along with the mathematical and computational methods used to model and analyze them.
These resources are suitable for both self-learning and classroom instruction.

You can learn to do cool things like the example below! ðŸš€

## Topics

The notebooks cover the following topics:

1. [Population Balances for Polymer Systems](./notebooks/1_population_balances.ipynb)
1. [Monte Carlo Model of An + Bm Polycondensation](./notebooks/2_monte_carlo_polycondensation.ipynb)
1. [Living Polymerization â€“ Chain Length Distribution](./notebooks/3_living_polymerization_distribution.ipynb)
1. [Living Polymerization â€“ CSTR Operation](./notebooks/4_living_polymerization_cstr.ipynb)
1. [Naive Radical Polymerization Model](./notebooks/5_radical_polymerization.ipynb)
1. [Pulsed-Laser Polymerization](./notebooks/6_pulsed_laser_polymerization.ipynb)

## Getting Started

To run the tutorials, you may use one of two methods:

* **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** â€” The notebooks can be opened
directly from the source code repository ("File -> Open notebook -> GitHub -> URL") using the
following repo name: `HugoMVale/Polymer-Reaction-Engineering-Lectures`. This method requires a
Google account.

* **Local environment** â€” Alternatively, you may clone or download this repository to your
local machine. This method requires a local Python installation as well as the packages listed
in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).
