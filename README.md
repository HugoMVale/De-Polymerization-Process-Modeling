This GitHub repository contains Jupyter notebooks to illustrate  various aspects of polymerization
reactions and the mathematical and computational methods used to model and analyze them. They
are suitable for self-learning as well as for classroom instruction.

## Topics

The notebooks cover the following topics:

1. [Population Balances for Polymer Systems](./notebooks/1_pbes.ipynb)
1. [Monte Carlo Model of $A_n$ + $B_m$ Polycondensation](./notebooks/2_monte_carlo_polycondensation.ipynb)
1. [Living Polymerization – Chain Length Distribution](./notebooks/3_living_polymerization_distribution.ipynb)
1. [Living Polymerization – CSTR Operation](./notebooks/4_living_polymerization_cstr.ipynb)
1. [Naive Radical Polymerization Model](./notebooks/5_radical_polymerization.ipynb)
1. [Pulsed-Laser Polymerization](./notebooks/6_pulsed_laser_polymerization.ipynb)

## Getting Started

To run the tutorials, you may use one of two methods:

* **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** — The notebooks can be opened
directly from the source code repository ("File -> Open notebook -> GitHub -> URL") using the
following repo name: `HugoMVale/Polymer-Reaction-Engineering-Lectures`. This method requires a
Google account.

* **Local environment** — Alternatively, you may clone or download this repository to your
local machine. This method requires a local Python installation as well as the packages listed
in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).
