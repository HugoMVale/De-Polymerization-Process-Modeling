This GitHub repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Matlab scripts for a series
of lectures on the modeling of (de)polymerization reactions. These
lectures are intended to provide a basic understanding of various aspects of polymerization
reactions and the mathematical and computational methods used to model and analyze them.

## Lecture Topics

The lectures are organized into the following topics:

1. Introduction to polymers and methods to compute distributed quantities

2. Kinetics and modeling of step-growth (de)polymerization

3. Kinetics and modeling of radical polymerization

4. Kinetics and modeling of radical copolymerization and pyrolysis.
