This GitHub repository contains Jupyter notebooks to illustrate  various aspects of polymerization
reactions and the mathematical and computational methods used to model and analyze them. They
are suitable for self-learning as well as for classroom instruction.

## Topics

The notebooks cover the following topics:

- [x] Methods for solving dynamic models and population balance equations.
- [x] Monte Carlo methods.
- [x] Step-growth (de)polymerization.
- [x] Radical polymerization.
- [x] Living polymerization.
- [ ] Radical copolymerization.

## Getting Started

To run the tutorials, you may use one of two methods:

* **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** — The notebooks can be opened
directly from the source code repository ("File -> Open notebook -> GitHub -> URL") using the
following repo name: `HugoMVale/Polymer-Reaction-Engineering-Lectures`. This method requires a
Google account.

* **Local environment** — Alternatively, you may clone or download this repository to your
local machine. This method requires a local Python installation as well as the packages listed
in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).
